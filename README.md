# About
This GNOME extension reads metadata information from an mpris compatible player and displays it on the top bar. It works with Spotify, Vlc, Rhythmbox, Chromium based browsers and (probably) any mpris compatible player.

This extension was originally a fork for [mheine's gnome spotify label](https://github.com/mheine/gnome-shell-spotify-label). It quickly spiraled out of control and i ended up replacing or reverting all but a hint of the original code, so i decided to start this repository from scratch.

The idea of supporting all mpris compatible players (and how to do it) comes from this [pull request](https://github.com/mheine/gnome-shell-spotify-label/pull/21) in mheine's extension.

## Installation

### Using extensions.gnome.org
[Install this extension from extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4928/mpris-label)

This is the recommended way of installing GNOME extensions, the browser plugin will install the extension in one click, and is just as easy to remove or manage.

It requires the installation of a browser plugin and a system package. Visit the page for further instructions.

### More info about the installation

The default installation path is: `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/mprisLabel@moon-0xff.github.com/`

This extension (for GNOME 47/48) can be installed by simply copying the repository to the default installation path.

GNOME 49+ compatibility isn't provided directly, it needs to be patched.  
The installation script will patch the extension if it detects a gnome-shell version above or equal to `49`.  
You can patch it manually by running: `$ patch < patches/gnome49-compatibility.patch`

Recently installed extensions are only available after `gnome-shell` is reloaded. On Gnome-Wayland is necessary to log out and log back in. On Gnome-Xorg the shell can be reloaded by running `r` on the 'Run as a command' prompt (default shortcut: `Alt+F2`).
