# About
This GNOME extension reads metadata information from an mpris compatible player and displays it on the top bar.

It works with Spotify, Vlc, Rhythmbox, Chromium based browsers and (probably) any mpris compatible player.

This was originally a fork of mheine's spotify-label. I've rewritten almost the entire original code and reverted almost every commit. So i decided to start this repository from scratch.

[Now avaliable at extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4928/mpris-label)
